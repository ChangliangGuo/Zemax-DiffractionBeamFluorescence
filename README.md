# Zemax-DiffractionBeamFluorescence

Diffracted beam propagation and fluorescence tools for Zemax-OptiStudio(TM)

This set of utilities can be used to calculate the propagation of a diffracted beam in Zemax-OpticStudio(TM), import or define a sample model, and calculate the spatial distribution of fluorescence emission based on the diffracted illumination intensity.

 (1) Folder "AngularSpectrumCalculator" contains add-on software to Zemax-OpticStudio(TM) to calculate the Angular Spectrum representation of a beam.

 (2) Folder "SourceFromDB" contains add-on software to Zemax-OpticStudio(TM) to implement a light source that generates rays from a data base stored in disk.

 (3) Folder "Matlab" contains sample code to read electric field calculated by (1) and to export database file that may be used by (2).
